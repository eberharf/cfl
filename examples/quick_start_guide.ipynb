    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Macrovariables are a useful way to summarize the relevant features detailed, low-level data at a higher level. For example, instead of keeping track of the kinetic energy of every particle in a room, we can instead monitor just the temperature of the room. In this case, 'temperature' is a macrovariable which summarizes the kinetic energy in the room. Additionally, all the particle configurations which have the same temperature (i.e. are part of the same macrovariable class) may differ in some ways, but for many purposes, are functionally the same. Thus, macrovariables can abstract away unnecessary information while preserving important distinctions. Which features are important to distinguish depends on the task for which the macrovariable is being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Causal Feature Learning (CFL) is an algorithm designed to construct macrovariables from low-level data in an unsupervised manner while accounting for the causal relationships between these macrovariables. CFL is designed to take two data sets as input. The `X` dataset contains all of the features which may potentially cause the effects seen in the `Y` dataset. The word \"potentially\" is used because both datasets may contain features which turn out not to be causally relevant; if that is the case, then CFL should not consider them when assigning a macrovariable label. CFL partitions each input dataset into a set of macrovariables: `X` into a set of macro-causes (e.g. the temperature of the room) and `Y` into a set of macro-effects (e.g. whether someone turns on the air conditioner). \n",
    "\n",
    "CFL works by first learning the conditional probability distribution $P(Y|X)$ (or some reasonable proxy for this distibution). This step is called conditional density estimation, or CDE. It then clusters together `X`s for which the equivalence relation $P(Y|X=x_1) = P(Y|X=x_2)$ is (approximately) true, followed by clustering `Y`s for which the relation $P(Y=y_1|X) = P(Y=y_2|X)$ approximately holds. Thus, CFL works in two steps: first, it estimates a conditional probability distribution; and second, it clusters based on that distribution. The image below provides a visual overview of the inputs and outputs of each step of CFL. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/CFLpipeline.png\" alt=\"Overview of CFL pipeline\" height=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, CFL learns a method to partition the sample space of each dataset. This information is contained in the parameters of the trained model. These parameters generate the labels that are output at the end of training and can be used to classify new data into macrovariables.\n"

    "## Background: Visual Bars Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we will use the Visual Bars dataset (from Chalupka 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "The causal dataset consists of a set of binary (black-and-white) images. These images each have a black background \n",
    "and contain white pixels of random noise. Each image may also contain either a white vertical and/or a horizontal bar. Below are a few sample images. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/vbImage1.png\" alt=\"Sample Visual Bars Image\" height=\"150\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/vbImage2.png\" alt=\"Sample Visual Bars Image\" height=\"150\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/vbImage3.png\" alt=\"Sample Visual Bars Image\" height=\"150\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect dataset (aka the \"target\") is, in this case, a single-dimensional, binary variable. In other words, there is only one variable in the target data set, and that variable can either take on the value of \"0\" or \"1\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying causal structure used to generate the visual bars images is shown below. The solid circles are the observed variables, the dotted lines are hidden (unobserved) variables, and the arrows denote a causal relationship from one variable to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/VisualBarsCausal.png\" alt=\"causal graph for visual bars\" height=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal graph includes two 'hidden variables' ($H_1$ and $H_2$), whether an image contains a horizontal and/or vertical bar, and the target variable's value. The values of hidden variables are not observed directly in the data, but they impact the values of variables that we do observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, when the $H_{1}$ hidden variable is \"on\", that causes a vertical bar to be present in the image. It also increases the probability that the target variable's value will be $1$. The $H_{2}$ hidden variable causes a horizontal bar to be present in the image, but does not directly impact the value of the target. The presence of a horizontal bar in the image increases the probability of the target's value being $1$, but the presence of a vertical bar does not directly impact the value of the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wow! All that's a little confusing. What does it mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this means that there is confounding in our data! You can see in the image above that $H_{1}$ has influence on both the contents of the images, and on the target directly. Confounding makes disentangling the causal relationships a little more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for this data set, we want CFL to separate the images into four observational macrovariables: one for each combination of values for $H_1$ and $H_2$. This will allow later researchers to design later experiments that determine which of the differences in these macrovariables are causally important (vs merely predictive).\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows the 'ground truth' probability of the target value being $1$, given each possible state of the hidden variables. These values are used to generate the target values. At the end of the CDE step of CFL, we want to recover these probabilities as accurately as possible, and by the end of the clustering step, recover these four categories.\n",
