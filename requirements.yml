# NOTE: this file contains somewhat repeated information with the requirements.txt on
# main branch 
# (the difference is that requirements.txt is for pip installing dependencies
# and this requirements.yml is for creating a conda virtual environment with the
# dependencies for cfl )
# TODO: this file may be useful if you clone the repository, but right now is not
# used/referenced in our current setup instructions

# this file contains the requirements for the cfl package

# to create a conda environment from this file, run the commands:
#     conda env create -f requirements.yml
#     conda activate cfl-env

# to generate a new version of this file from the current environment, run the command:
#     conda env export --from-history > requirementsNEW.yml

# TODO: this file duplicates some information in the setup.py file  
# and also has some packages probably should not be included in the
# 'distribution' of CFL
