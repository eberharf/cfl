''' The following code checks that past CDE results are the same current CDE
results (on the same dataset with the same parameters), within a tolerance. 

This code is pretty sketchy and doesn't work that well. I haven't figured out a
better way to regression test the CDE though. 

The 'correct' results to compare against are generated by running the
generate_for_cde_regression file.
