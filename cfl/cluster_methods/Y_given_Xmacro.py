    """
    Estimates the conditional probability density `P(Y=y|X=xClass)` for every y
    (observation in Y_data) and xClass (macrovariable constructed from X_data,
    the "causal" data set) when Y_data contains variable(s) over a continuous
    distribution.

    This function approximates the probability density `P(Y=y_1)` by using the
    density of points around `y_1`, as determined by the average distance
    between the k nearest neighbors. (Small distance=high density, large
    distance=low density) as a proxy.
    
    Pseudocode:
      - use sklearn's euclidean_distances function to precompute distances
        between all pairs of points in Y_data
      - separate these distances out by X class
      - sort these distances
      - for each X class, the steps so far give us a matrix of sorted 
        distances from each point in Y_data to each point in the X class
      - now we can go through each point in Y_data, pull the first k
        columns of distances for each X class matrix, and take the average.
        This gives us the average of the closest k distances in each X class

    Parameters: 
        Y_data (np.ndarray): the "effects" data set, the observations in
            which are to be clustered 
        x_lbls (np.ndarray): a 1D array (same
            length/aligned with `Y_data`) of the CFL labels predicted for the 
            `X` (cause) data
        precompute_distances (boolean): when True, distances between all 
            samples will be precomputed. This will significantly speed up
            this function, but uses considerable space for larger datasets.

    Returns: 
        np.ndarray: a 2D array with a row for each observation in Y_data
            and a column for each class in x_lbls. The entries of the array 
            contain the conditional probability `P(y|x)` for the corresponding 
            y value, given that the x is a member of the corresponding class of 
            that column.

    Note: 
        Why is `P(y|x_Class)` calculated, instead of `P(y|x)` for each
        individual `x`? The clusters of `x` created immediately prior to this
        step are observational classes of `X` (see "Causal Feature Learning: An
        Overview" by Eberhardt, Chalupka, Pierona 2017). Observational classes
        are a type of equivalence class defined by the relationship
        `P(y|x_1)=P(y|x_2)` for any `x_1`, `x_2` in the same class. So,
        theoretically, it should be redundant to check each `x` observation
        individually since each `x` in the same cluster should have the same
        effect on the conditional probability of `y`. This method also
        significantly reduces the amount of computation that needs to be done.
