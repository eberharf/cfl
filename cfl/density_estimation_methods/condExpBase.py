    ''' A class to define, train, and perform inference with conditional density
    estimators that fall under the "conditional expectation" umbrella. This
    subset of conditional density estimators (referred to as 'CondExp') learns
    E[P(Y|X)] instead of the full conditional distribution. This base class
    implements all functions needed for training and predictiion, and supplies
    a model architecture that can be overridden by children of this class. In
    general, if you would like to use a CondExp CDE for your CFL pipeline, it is
    easiest to either 1) inherit this class and override the build_model
    function, which defines the architecture, or 2) use the condExpMod child
    class which allows you to pass in limited architecture specifications
    through the params attribute.

    Attributes:
        name : name of the model so that the model type can be recovered from
               saved parameters (str)
        data_info : dict with information about the dataset shape (dict)
        default_params : default parameters to fill in if user doesn't provide
                         a given entry (dict)
        params : parameters for the CDE that are passed in by the user and
                 corrected by check_save_model_params (dict)
        trained : whether or not the modeled has been trained yet. This can
                  either happen by defining by instantiating the class and
                  calling train, or by passing in a path to saved weights from
                  a previous training session through params['weights_path'].
                  (bool)
        weights_loaded : whether or not weights were loaded from
                         params['weights_path]. (bool)
        model : tensorflow model for this CDE (tf.keras.Model.Sequential)


    Methods:
        train : train the neural network on a given Dataset
        graph_results : helper function to graph training and validation loss
        predict : once the model is trained, predict for a given Dataset
        evaluate : return the model's prediction loss on a Dataset
        load_model : load tensorflow model weights from a file into
                          self.model
        save_model : save the current weights of self.model
        build_model : create and return a tensorflow model
        _check_model_params : fill in any parameters that weren't provided in
                             params with the default value, and discard any
                             unnecessary paramaters that were provided.
