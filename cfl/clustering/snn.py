This code provides an implementation of Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Clustering
for use in the clustering step of CFL. 

SNN is a variation of DBSCAN that uses a non-Euclidean distance metric to
cluster points. It was developed as an alternative to DBSCAN that performs
better at creating clusters across regions with variable densities of points.

We implement it here as a method that may do better in high-dimensional spaces. 
Clustering methods that use Euclidean distance metrics tend to perform poorly in
high-dimensional spaces because the distances between all points become
approximately equal as dimensionality increases. Instead of finding nearby
points with Euclidean distance, SNN uses an alternative distance metric based on
the neighbor of nearest neighbors shared between two points. However, SNN
clustering still (in the current implementation) uses Euclidean distance to
construct the k-nearest neighbors graph, so this method may also suffer from
some of the shortfalls of other clustering methods in high-dimensional space.


This method is also an example of a custom clustering method that can be used
for CFL clustering in the exact same way as any other Sklearn clustering method
because it follows the same interface. 


this code is modified by Jenna Kahn from the implemention in
" Shared Nearest Neighbor Clustering Algorithm: Implementation and Evaluation "
in github repository  albert-espin/snn-clustering
