Sankey diagram code

Create a Sankey diagram to show how samples move between clusters when cluster
parameters are varied. 

Usage of this function:

```
  import plotly.graph_objects as go
  from cfl.visualization_methods import clustering_to_sankey as sk

  #x_lbls_L = list of x labels from several different rounds of clustering on the same data

  link, label = sk.convert_lbls_to_sankey_nodes(x_lbls_L)
  # plot
  fig = go.Figure(data=
            [go.Sankey(node = dict(pad = 15, thickness=20, label = label, color =  "blue"),
                      link = link)])

  fig.update_layout(title_text="Sample Sankey", font_size=10)
  fig.show()
```

def convert_lbls_to_sankey_nodes(x_lbls_L):

    Parameters
    -----------
    x_lbls_L: x_lbls_L is a list of x_lbls, the result from multiple kmeans clusterings on the same data

    Returns
    ----------
    link (dict): a representation of nodes and weighted connections between them to make a Sankey diagram
    labels (list): labels for every node in the sankey diagram
