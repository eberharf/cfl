# Contribute to CFL

Contributions to `cfl` are welcomed and encouraged! Here are some ways to 
contribute.

### Submit a bug report or feature request
Please include:
- a short code snippet that reproduces the issue
- any error tracebacks
- operating system type and version number, python version number, and 
  cfl version number

### Contribute code, docs, and tests (more detailed instructions to come)
- fork the cfl repository
- clone your fork to your local machine
- install the development dependencies in requirements.yml
- add the upstream remote
- sync your main branch with the upstream main branch
- create a feature branch and make your changes on it
- run pytest to ensure all tests still pass
- commit and push
- open a pull request

### Contribute `Block`s
Did you develop your own conditional probability estimator or clusterer while
performing your analysis? Please consider sharing it with others! Your `Block`
should:
- algorithmically align with the type of `Block` it is (i.e. a new 
  `CauseClusterer` `Block` should perform unsupervised clustering on the 
  conditional probabilities estimated by any `CondProbEstimator` and
  return cluster labels over all samples)
- be placed in the corresponding directory
- pass all associated tests (instructions to come for how to test your 
  `Block`)
- inherit the `Block` class or a child of the `Block` class
Please follow the instructions under "Contribute code" to create a pull request.

### Contribute examples
Have a cool dataset you've run `cfl` on? We'd love to see it!
- Put together a concise Jupyter Notebook with some background on your data
  and an annotated run of CFL, similar to the [El Ni√±o example notebook]
  (https://cfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/el_nino_example.html).
- Include this notebook in the `docs/source/user_examples/` directory.
- Follow the instructions under "Contribute code" to create a pull request.
